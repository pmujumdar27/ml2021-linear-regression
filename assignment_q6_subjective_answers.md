> In this question we plot magnitude of theta vs degree for varying number of samples. The graphs and insights are given below.

![Theta vs Degree of Polynomial Features for varying number of samples](plots/q6.png)

- The pattern for degree follows from the previous question (exponential)
- With increasing number of samples (```N```) the magnitude of theta increases because the model tries to fit more number of samples
- The model increases thetas to more fine tune in order to fit more samples.
